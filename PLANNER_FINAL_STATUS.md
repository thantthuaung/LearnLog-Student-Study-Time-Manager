### Manual Test Checklist
- [ ] Open Planner tab from bottom nav
- [ ] See current month calendar with today highlighted
- [ ] Navigate to previous/next month
- [ ] Tap "Today" button jumps back
- [ ] Create a task in Tasks page, see dot appear on Planner
- [ ] Tap a date with tasks, see task list below
- [ ] Try each filter chip (All/Pending/etc.)
- [ ] Long-press a task → select "Reschedule"
- [ ] Try "Tomorrow" quick option, verify task moves
- [ ] Try "Pick Date & Time" custom option
- [ ] Tap FAB (+), verify selected date is prefilled
- [ ] Complete a task, see dot turn gray
- [ ] Start timer on a task from Planner
- [ ] Delete a task, see dot update immediately
- [ ] Rotate device, state is preserved

## 🎯 How Planner & Tasks Work Together

### Planner Purpose
- **View**: When are tasks due (calendar overview)
- **Focus**: Time-based scheduling
- **Best For**: Planning ahead, rescheduling, avoiding conflicts

### Tasks Purpose  
- **View**: What needs to be done (list view)
- **Focus**: Task completion and execution
- **Best For**: Daily work, marking complete, quick task entry

### Sync Behavior
- Both observe `taskRepository.getTasks()` Flow
- Any change in one → immediately visible in the other
- Single source of truth (Room database)
- No manual refresh needed

### Example Workflow
1. User creates task in **Tasks** → dot appears in **Planner**
2. User sees conflict in **Planner** → reschedules → updates in **Tasks**
3. User completes task in **Tasks** → dot turns gray in **Planner**
4. User deletes task in **Planner** → removed from **Tasks** list

## 🐛 Known Limitations (Future Enhancements)
- No drag-and-drop reschedule (can be added)
- No week view (month only currently)
- No recurring tasks (can be added)
- No task count badge when > 3 tasks per day
- No undo for delete (TODO comment exists)
