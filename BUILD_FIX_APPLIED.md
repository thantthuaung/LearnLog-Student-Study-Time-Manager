# Build Fix Applied ✅

## Issue
Build was failing with lint error:
```
Error: foregroundServiceType:dataSync requires permission:[android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC]
```

## Root Cause
Android 14+ (API 34+) requires specific foreground service permissions for each `foregroundServiceType`. Our `TimerService` uses `foregroundServiceType="dataSync"` but was missing the corresponding permission.

## Fix Applied
Added the required permission to `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC" />
```

## Status
✅ **Build should now succeed**

The error has been fixed. The remaining warnings are:
- Kotlin deprecation warnings (non-blocking)
- Lint warnings (309 total, mostly minor style issues)

These warnings don't prevent the build from completing.

## Next Steps
1. Run build again: `./gradlew clean build assembleDebug`
2. Build should complete successfully
3. Install and test: `./gradlew installDebug`

## Technical Details
- **Android 14+ Requirement**: Each foreground service type needs explicit permission
- **Service Type**: `dataSync` (used for timer synchronization)
- **Permission Added**: `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC`
- **Impact**: None on functionality, just allows the service to run on Android 14+
