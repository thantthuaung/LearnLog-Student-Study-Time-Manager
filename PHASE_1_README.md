## 🎯 What's NOT Included (Future Phases)

Phase 1 focused on **core functionality**. These are planned for later:

- ⏸️ Dark theme support
- ⏸️ Cloud sync / backup
- ⏸️ Home screen widgets
- ⏸️ Advanced analytics
- ⏸️ Recurring tasks
- ⏸️ Multi-device support
- ⏸️ Social features

## ⚠️ Known Minor Issues

These are **non-critical warnings** that don't affect functionality:

1. Some unused StateFlow properties in TimerService (prepared for future binding)
2. Minor string format warnings (can use string resources in future)
3. Unused exception variables in catch blocks

**All can be fixed in future refactoring without affecting current functionality.**
