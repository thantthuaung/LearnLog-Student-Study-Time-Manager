## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `CalendarDay.kt` - Data model for calendar cells
2. `CalendarAdapter.kt` - RecyclerView adapter for calendar grid
3. `RescheduleTaskBottomSheet.kt` - Quick reschedule dialog
4. `item_calendar_day.xml` - Calendar cell layout
5. `bottom_sheet_reschedule_task.xml` - Reschedule dialog layout
6. `task_indicator_dot.xml` - Drawable for task dots
7. `ic_arrow_back.xml` - Navigation icon
8. `ic_arrow_forward.xml` - Navigation icon

### Modified Files
1. `fragment_planner.xml` - Complete calendar-based layout
2. `PlannerFragment.kt` - Calendar logic and interactions
3. `PlannerViewModel.kt` - Calendar generation and task filtering
4. `colors.xml` - Added `text_hint` color
5. `dimens.xml` - Added `task_indicator_dot_size`

## Technical Implementation

### Calendar Generation Algorithm
- Calculates first day of month and adjusts for week start (Sunday)
- Fills previous month's trailing days
- Adds all days of current month
- Completes grid with next month's leading days (total 42 cells)
- Efficiently computes task counts and status per day

### Task Filtering
- Filters by LocalDate (converts LocalDateTime to LocalDate for comparison)
- Supports status filters: PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, OVERDUE
- Sorts by priority (descending) then due time (ascending)

### Performance
- StateFlow with WhileSubscribed(5000) for efficient lifecycle management
- Grid layout with fixed size for smooth scrolling
- Minimal recomposition with proper Diff callbacks

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
- [ ] Drag & drop reschedule (long-press task, drag to another date)
- [ ] Week view toggle
- [ ] Task count badges on dates (when > 3 tasks)
- [ ] Monthly overview widget
- [ ] Recurring tasks support
- [ ] Bulk reschedule operations
