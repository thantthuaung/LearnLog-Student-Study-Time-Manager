# 🚀 QUICK START - What To Do Right Now

## Step 1: Fix the Build (2 minutes)

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
cd /Users/thantthuaung/StudioProjects/LearnLog-Student-Study-Time-Manager

# Make the script executable
chmod +x clean_and_build.sh

# Run the clean build
./clean_and_build.sh
```

**Why this is failing:** The Android build system has cached old resource files. A clean build will resolve this.

---

## Step 2: Install and Test the App (30-60 minutes)

Once the build succeeds, install the APK:

```bash
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

**Or** run from Android Studio: Click the green "Play" button

### Critical Test Cases:
1. ✅ Sign up with email/password
2. ✅ Sign in with Google
3. ✅ Create a task → Start timer → Complete
4. ✅ View calendar, schedule task
5. ✅ Check insights/analytics
6. ✅ Create a note
7. ✅ Export data → Clear app → Import data
8. ✅ Test offline (airplane mode)

---

## Step 3: Set Up Production Firebase (15 minutes)

### Why You Need This:
- Your current Firebase is for development
- Production needs separate credentials for security
- Enables analytics and crash reporting

### How to Do It:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Add Project" or use existing "learnlog-1babb" for prod
3. Add Android app:
   - Package name: `com.example.learnlog`
   - Download NEW `google-services.json`
4. Enable these services:
   - Authentication (Email/Password + Google)
   - Analytics
   - Crashlytics
   - Performance Monitoring

5. Replace the google-services.json:
```bash
# Backup current one
mv app/google-services.json app/google-services-dev.json

# Add production one
cp ~/Downloads/google-services.json app/
```

---

## Step 4: Create Signed Release Build (10 minutes)

### Generate a Keystore:
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/learnlog-release.keystore \
  -alias learnlog -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

**Important:** Save the password somewhere safe!

### Update Build Configuration:

Create `keystore.properties` in project root:
```properties
storeFile=/Users/thantthuaung/learnlog-release.keystore
storePassword=YOUR_STORE_PASSWORD
keyAlias=learnlog
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
```

### Build Release APK:
```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

Output: `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

---

## Step 5: Prepare for Play Store (1-2 hours)

### What You Need:

1. **Screenshots** (Take from your running app)
   - Tasks screen
   - Timer running
   - Calendar view
   - Analytics dashboard
   - At least 2, max 8 screenshots

2. **App Description** (Write this):
