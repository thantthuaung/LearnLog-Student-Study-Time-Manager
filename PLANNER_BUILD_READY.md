## ✅ PLANNER PAGE - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

### What Was Built
A fully functional calendar-based Planner page that syncs in real-time with the Tasks database.

### Key Features
- 📅 **Month Calendar Grid** - 42-cell calendar with task indicators (dots)
- 🎯 **Smart Date Selection** - Tap any date to see tasks for that day
- 🔍 **Filter System** - All / Pending / In Progress / Completed / Overdue
- 🔄 **Quick Reschedule** - Move tasks to Today, Tomorrow, Weekend, or custom date
- ➕ **Add Task** - FAB button pre-fills selected date
- ⏱️ **Timer Integration** - Start timer directly from Planner
- 🔗 **Real-time Sync** - Changes in Planner ↔ Tasks instantly
- 🎨 **Visual Indicators**:
  - 🔵 Blue dots = normal tasks
  - 🔴 Red dots = overdue or high priority  
  - ⚪ Gray dots = completed
  - Red underline = day has overdue tasks
  - Blue border = selected date
  - Light blue bg = today

### Files Created
- `CalendarDay.kt` - Calendar cell data model
- `CalendarAdapter.kt` - Grid adapter for calendar
- `RescheduleTaskBottomSheet.kt` - Quick reschedule dialog
- `item_calendar_day.xml` - Calendar cell layout
- `bottom_sheet_reschedule_task.xml` - Reschedule dialog UI
- `task_indicator_dot.xml` - Task dot drawable
- `ic_arrow_back.xml` & `ic_arrow_forward.xml` - Navigation icons
- `PLANNER_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Full documentation
- `PLANNER_TASKS_INTEGRATION.md` - Integration guide

### Files Modified
- `fragment_planner.xml` - Complete calendar UI
- `PlannerFragment.kt` - Calendar interactions
- `PlannerViewModel.kt` - Calendar logic & data
- `colors.xml` - Added text_hint
- `dimens.xml` - Added dot size
- `strings.xml` - Added planner strings

### How It Works
1. **ViewModel** generates 42 calendar days (6 weeks) with task data
2. **CalendarAdapter** displays grid with dots per day
3. **Tap date** → shows tasks for that day below calendar
4. **Filter chips** → refine visible tasks
5. **All actions** (add/edit/delete/reschedule) update Room DB
6. **Flow observation** → UI updates automatically everywhere

### Testing Steps
```bash
# 1. Build
cd /Users/thantthuaung/AndroidStudioProjects/LearnLog
./gradlew clean assembleDebug

# 2. Test
- Open Planner tab
- Navigate months with arrows
- Tap dates with tasks
- Try filters
- Long-press task → Reschedule
- Add task from FAB
- Start timer on a task
- Go to Tasks → verify sync
```

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(planner): Add calendar-based scheduling with real-time sync
