# Quick Build & Test Guide

## Build the App

```bash
cd /Users/thantthuaung/StudioProjects/LearnLog-Student-Study-Time-Manager
./gradlew clean build assembleDebug
```

## ⚠️ Build Issue Fixed
**Duplicate Resources:** Removed duplicate `black` and `primary_light_blue` colors from `session_colors.xml` that were conflicting with `colors.xml`. Build should now succeed.

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ Theme Changes
- Locked to **Material 3 Light theme** (no dark mode)
- Disabled **dynamic colors** (wallpaper won't affect UI)
- Disabled **elevation overlays** (no gray tint on cards)
- Disabled **force dark** (Android won't auto-invert colors)

### ✅ Component Fixes

**Cards:**
- White background (#FFFFFF), no gray overlay
- Consistent 2dp elevation

**Chips:**
- Filter chips: Light gray → Blue when selected
- Subject chips: Always blue with white text

**Calendar:**
- Day numbers: Dark text (#0D2A3A) on white
- Task dots: Blue/Amber/Gray/Red status colors
- Clear selected/today indicators

**Bottom Navigation:**
- Floating blue pill (#43B8FF)
- White icons and text

## Expected Result
App looks **identical on emulator and physical device**:
- Bright, light theme
- Blue (#43B8FF) primary color
- White cards (not gray)
- Dark, readable text
- No wallpaper interference

## Test Checklist
1. [ ] Cards are white
2. [ ] Chips show correct colors
3. [ ] Calendar is readable
4. [ ] Bottom nav is blue
5. [ ] Stays light in dark mode
6. [ ] Looks same as emulator

## Files Changed
- **4** theme files (forced light mode)
- **2** new chip color selectors
- **1** colors.xml (added missing colors)
- **1** styles.xml (added chip/card styles)
- **8** layouts (updated chip styles)
- **1** AndroidManifest.xml

Total: **17 files**

## No Logic Changes
✅ Only UI/theme/styling modified
✅ No Kotlin/Java code touched
✅ No database changes
✅ Navigation unchanged
✅ All features work as before
