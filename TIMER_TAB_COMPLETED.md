## üîß Technical Details

### State Management
```kotlin
- IDLE: Ready to start, showing preset duration
- RUNNING: Countdown active, notification visible
- PAUSED: Countdown stopped, can resume
```

### Database Schema
```kotlin
SessionLogEntity(
    taskId = null,              // Standalone session
    subject = "Focus Session",
    startTime = LocalDateTime,
    endTime = LocalDateTime,
    durationMinutes = Int,
    type = "FOCUS",
    isCompleted = Boolean
)
```

### Notification Intent
```kotlin
Intent extras:
- "open_timer_tab" = true
Navigates to timerFragment when tapped
```

## üéØ Usage Flow

### Standard Session
1. User opens Timer tab from bottom navigation
2. Selects a duration preset (or Custom)
3. Optionally adjusts with +5m/-1m buttons
4. Taps Start
5. Timer runs with circular progress and notification
6. On completion: sound plays, session saves, UI resets

### Background Operation
1. User starts timer
2. Navigates away or minimizes app
3. Notification continues showing countdown
4. Tapping notification returns to Timer tab
5. Timer completes even in background

### Pause & Resume
1. While running, tap Pause
2. Timer stops, notification shows "Paused"
3. Tap Resume to continue
4. Or tap Reset to cancel

## üé® UI/UX Highlights

- **Clean Design**: Matches app's material design theme
- **Large Countdown**: Easy to read at a glance

## üîÑ Integration Points

### With Task Timer Sheet
- **Separate Logic**: Timer tab is completely independent
- **Shared ViewModel**: Uses same TimerViewModel for session logging
- **Different UI**: Full screen vs bottom sheet modal
- **No Conflicts**: Can't run both simultaneously (by design)

### With Insights
- **Session Export**: All completed sessions flow to Insights
- **Analytics**: Duration, frequency, and patterns tracked
- **Real-time**: Updates visible immediately after completion

### With Navigation
- **Bottom Nav**: Seamlessly integrated with bottom navigation
- **Notification**: Deep links back to Timer tab
- **Back Stack**: Proper navigation hierarchy maintained

---

## üìä Performance

- **Memory**: Minimal footprint, proper cleanup
- **Battery**: Efficient countdown with 1-second ticks
- **Notification**: Updates every 10 seconds (not every second)
- **Database**: Async operations, no main thread blocking

---

## üöÄ Ready for Production

The Timer tab is fully functional, tested, and ready for user testing. It provides a professional, polished experience for standalone focus sessions.

### Key Benefits
1. **Independence**: Works without any task context
2. **Reliability**: Handles all lifecycle events correctly
3. **Flexibility**: Multiple presets plus custom durations
4. **Trackability**: All sessions logged for analytics
5. **Usability**: Intuitive controls and feedback

---

## üìù Notes

- No task status changes occur from this timer (by design)
- Sessions are logged as "Focus Session" with no task link
- Notification requires app to be in foreground or background (not force-stopped)
- Custom duration picker uses Material Time Picker for consistency
- Preset selection state persists across app restarts

---

## üéâ Summary

The Timer tab is now a complete, standalone timer page accessible from the bottom navigation. Users can start focus sessions of any duration, track their progress with visual feedback, and have all sessions automatically logged for insights. The implementation is robust, handles all edge cases, and provides a smooth, professional user experience.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and Ready for Use
