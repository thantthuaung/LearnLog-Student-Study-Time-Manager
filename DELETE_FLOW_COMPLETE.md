# Delete Flow Implementation Complete

## Summary
Successfully replaced the buggy swipe-to-delete with a reliable long-press delete flow.

## What Was Changed

### 1. **Removed Swipe-to-Delete**
- ✅ Removed all `ItemTouchHelper` code from `TasksFragment`
- ✅ Removed red/green swipe background decorators
- ✅ Removed `Canvas` drawing code for swipe indicators
- ✅ Removed swipe gesture handling

### 2. **Added Long-Press Menu**
- ✅ Long-press on any task card shows action menu with:
  - **Mark Completed** - Marks task as completed
  - **Edit** - Opens edit bottom sheet
  - **Duplicate** - Creates a copy of the task
  - **Delete** - Shows delete confirmation (in red, last option)

### 3. **Delete Confirmation Dialog**
- ✅ Shows dialog: "Delete task \"{title}\"?"
- ✅ Message: "This will remove the task from Tasks. Study sessions remain."
- ✅ Two buttons: Cancel (default) and Delete (destructive)
- ✅ Clear, user-friendly confirmation

### 4. **Optimistic Deletion with Undo**
- ✅ On confirm, task is immediately deleted from Room database
- ✅ ListAdapter + DiffUtil automatically animates removal
- ✅ List reflows smoothly without red artifacts
- ✅ Snackbar shows: "Task deleted" with UNDO for 5 seconds
- ✅ UNDO restores the task to the database

### 5. **Empty State Handling**
- ✅ When last task is deleted, empty state automatically appears
- ✅ Uses existing `binding.emptyState.isVisible` logic

## Files Modified

### TasksFragment.kt
- Removed: All swipe-related imports (`Canvas`, `Color`, `ColorDrawable`, `ItemTouchHelper`, `RecyclerView`)
- Removed: `setupSwipeToDelete()` method (80+ lines)
- Added: `showTaskActionsMenu()` - Shows action sheet on long-press
- Added: `showDeleteConfirmation()` - Shows delete dialog
- Added: `performDelete()` - Handles deletion with undo
- Added: `duplicateTask()` - Handles task duplication
- Updated: `setupRecyclerView()` to include `onLongPress` callback

### TaskEntityAdapter.kt
- Added: `onLongPress: (TaskEntity) -> Unit` callback parameter
- Added: Long-press listener to card `itemView`

### TasksViewModel.kt
- Added: `deleteTaskWithUndo(task: TaskEntity)` - Deletes task from repository
- Added: `restoreTask(task: TaskEntity)` - Restores deleted task
- Kept existing: All other methods unchanged

### dialog_delete_task.xml
- Created: Simple dialog layout (not used in simplified version)
- Can be used later for "delete sessions" checkbox option

## How It Works

1. **User long-presses** a task card
2. **Action menu appears** with 4 options
3. **User taps Delete** → Confirmation dialog appears
4. **User confirms** → Task is deleted from DB
5. **ListAdapter automatically** animates card removal
6. **Snackbar appears** with UNDO option
7. **If UNDO tapped** → Task is restored to DB
8. **ListAdapter automatically** re-adds card with animation

## Key Features

✅ **No red artifacts** - No swipe backgrounds or colored overlays
✅ **Smooth animations** - DiffUtil handles all list animations
✅ **Reliable** - No swipe gesture bugs or conflicts
✅ **Undoable** - 5-second window to undo deletion
✅ **User-friendly** - Clear action menu with confirmation
✅ **Accessible** - Long-press is discoverable and easy to use
✅ **Empty state** - Automatically shown when last task deleted

## What's NOT Changed

✅ Task card layout - Identical spacing, shadows, styling
✅ Start Timer button - Works exactly as before
✅ Edit button - Works exactly as before
✅ Checkbox - Works exactly as before
✅ Filters & sorting - Works exactly as before
✅ Add Task FAB - Works exactly as before
✅ Bottom navigation - Works exactly as before

- Track original position for better undo restoration

## Status

All swipe-to-delete code has been removed. The new long-press delete flow is stable, animated, and undoable!
