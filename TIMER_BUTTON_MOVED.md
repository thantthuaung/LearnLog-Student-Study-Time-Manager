# Timer Button Layout Update

## Change Made
✅ Moved the **Start/Pause button** to directly under the clock (countdown timer)

## Layout Structure (New Order)
1. Top Bar
2. Task Info Container (hidden for standalone timer)
3. **Countdown Clock (circular timer)**
4. **→ Start/Pause Button** ⭐ (MOVED HERE - centered, 200dp width)
5. Time Adjustment Buttons (-1m / +5m)
6. Quick Presets Grid
7. Settings Toggles
8. Task Action Buttons (hidden for standalone timer)
9. Reset Button (centered, 200dp width)

## What Changed
- **Before**: Start/Pause button was at the bottom with Reset button side-by-side
- **After**: Start/Pause button is now directly under the clock, centered
- Reset button remains at the bottom, now centered by itself

## Visual Improvement
The Start button is now more prominent and immediately visible after the timer display, making it easier to start/pause the timer without scrolling.

## Files Modified
- `app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_timer.xml`

## Status
✅ Layout updated successfully
✅ No errors, only warnings about hardcoded strings (non-blocking)
✅ Ready to build and test
