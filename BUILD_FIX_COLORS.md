# Build Fix Applied - Colors Added

## Issue
Build was failing due to missing color resources in auth layouts:
- `background_color`
- `divider_color`

## Solution
Added the missing colors to `/app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml`:

```xml
<color name="background_color">#F8F9FB</color>
<color name="divider_color">#E0E0E0</color>
```

## Build Command
```bash
cd /Users/thantthuaung/StudioProjects/LearnLog-Student-Study-Time-Manager
./gradlew clean assembleDebug
```

## Status
✅ Color resources added
✅ Ready to build

The IDE errors showing "Cannot resolve symbol" are normal before Gradle sync - they will resolve after the build completes.

## Important: Firebase Setup Required
Before the app will work properly, you must:

1. **Update Web Client ID** in `FirebaseModule.kt` (line 37)
2. **Enable Auth Methods** in Firebase Console
3. **Add SHA-1 Fingerprint** for Google Sign-In

See `FIREBASE_AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for detailed instructions.
