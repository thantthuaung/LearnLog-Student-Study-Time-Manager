### Priority 2: Set Up Production Firebase (15 minutes)

**Why:** Your current Firebase is development. You need production for:
- Better security
- Analytics tracking
- Crash reporting
- Separate user base

**How:**

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Click "Add project" (or use existing if you want)
3. Name it "LearnLog Production"
4. Enable Google Analytics (click Yes)
5. Click "Add app" → Android
6. Package name: `com.example.learnlog`
7. Download the **new** `google-services.json`
8. Replace the file:
   ```bash
   # Backup current
   cp app/google-services.json app/google-services-dev.json
   
   # Copy new one
   cp ~/Downloads/google-services.json app/
   ```
9. In Firebase Console, enable:
   - **Authentication** → Email/Password ✅
   - **Authentication** → Google ✅
   - **Analytics** (already enabled)
   - **Crashlytics** (Install SDK - I can help)

10. Rebuild app:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew clean assembleDebug
    ```

---

### Priority 3: Create Privacy Policy (30 minutes)

**Required by Google Play Store!**

**Option 1: Use Generator (Easy)**
1. Go to https://app-privacy-policy-generator.nisrulz.com/
2. Fill in:
   - App name: LearnLog
   - Your name/company
   - Email: your@email.com
   - Select: Android
   - Data collected: Email, Study data
   - Third party services: Firebase, Google Sign-In
3. Generate and download HTML
4. Host it:
   - GitHub Pages (free)
   - Your own website
   - Or use: https://termsfeed.com/

**Option 2: Template I Can Provide**
Tell me and I'll create a privacy policy template for you.

**You need:** A URL like `https://yourusername.github.io/learnlog-privacy.html`

---

### Priority 4: Take Screenshots (30 minutes)

You need **at least 2, maximum 8** screenshots for Play Store.

**How to take them:**

1. Open app on your device
2. Navigate to each screen
3. Press **Volume Down + Power** to screenshot
4. Transfer to computer

**Which screens to capture:**
1. **Tasks screen** - Show some tasks with different priorities
2. **Timer running** - Show active timer at 20:00
3. **Calendar view** - Show month with tasks
4. **Analytics dashboard** - Show charts and stats
5. **Notes list** - Show a few colorful notes
6. **Login screen** - Clean, professional

**Requirements:**
- Minimum resolution: 320px
- Maximum dimension: 3840px
- Aspect ratio: 16:9 or 9:16
- Format: PNG or JPEG

---

### Priority 5: Create Keystore (5 minutes)

**What it is:** A signing key for your app (like a password)

**How to create:**

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/learnlog-release.keystore \
  -alias learnlog \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000
```

**You'll be asked:**
- Password: (create one, WRITE IT DOWN!)
- Name: Your name
- Organization: Leave blank or your name
- City, State, Country: Your location

**IMPORTANT:** 
- Save the password somewhere safe!
- Never commit the keystore to Git
- Keep a backup in a secure location
- If you lose it, you can never update your app

**After creating**, you'll use it to sign release builds.
