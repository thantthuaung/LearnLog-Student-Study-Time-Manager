3. Session is saved to database
4. Success message appears: "Session saved! Great focus session!"

## Best Practices

1. **Choose Realistic Durations**: Start with 25-30 minutes if new to focused work
2. **Enable Sound**: Helps you know when session completes
3. **Use Custom for Specific Goals**: e.g., exactly 90 minutes for a lecture
4. **Check Insights**: Review your focus patterns weekly
5. **Don't Interrupt**: Avoid pausing unless necessary - finish the session!
