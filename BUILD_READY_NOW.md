**Status: ✅ Ready to Build**  
**Date: October 30, 2025**

---

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Corrupted fragment_login.xml
**Problem:** XML file had malformed structure causing "Content is not allowed in prolog" error  
**Solution:** Completely recreated the file with proper XML structure  
**Location:** `/app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_login.xml`

### 2. ✅ Web Client ID Missing
**Problem:** Google Sign-In needed Web Client ID  
**Solution:** Added your Web Client ID to strings.xml  
**Value:** `762310666511-c2ik8qs34mok05i2leoi2igjabtpsp5t.apps.googleusercontent.com`

### 3. ✅ Color Resources Verified
**Problem:** Build was looking for color resources  
**Solution:** Verified all colors are properly defined in colors.xml  
**Resources:**
- `background_color` → #F8F9FB
- `divider_color` → #E0E0E0
- `primary_blue` → #2196F3
- `text_primary` → #0D2A3A
- `text_secondary` → #7A8A99
